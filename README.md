# TwitterBot

This twitter bot has been created using python and tweepy.

It reads a random line from a text file every 8 hours. I have included Roger's Profanisaurus within the text file.

The aim of the twitter bot is for fun and ideally as a parody, but could be used for any purpose that requires tweets of random content to be sent at set intervals. 

All of this can easily be modified to suit.

Enjoy!
